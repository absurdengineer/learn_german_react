1;Greetings & Formalities;The First Conversation;Welcome to Day 1! This is the most crucial lesson for making a great first impression. We will dive deep into the essential greetings and the non-negotiable cultural rule of formal vs. informal address.;"**80/20 Focus:** Mastering `Guten Tag`, `Danke`, `Bitte`, and knowing when to use `Sie` will navigate you through 80% of your first polite interactions. This is the absolute foundation.\n\n**1. Detailed Greetings by Time:**\n* `Guten Morgen` (Good Morning): Use from waking up until about 10-11 AM. A simple `Morgen!` is common among colleagues or friends.\n* `Guten Tag` (Good Day): The universal, polite greeting from ~11 AM until evening (~6 PM). It is never wrong during the daytime. A casual version is `Tag!`.\n* `Guten Abend` (Good Evening): Used from ~6 PM onwards. A casual `Abend!` is also possible.\n* `Hallo` is a universal, more casual 'hello', perfect for peers.\n* `Tschüss` (Bye) is the standard friendly goodbye. `Auf Wiedersehen` is more formal (literally 'until we see again') and is common in shops.\n\n**2. The Concept of Sie vs. du (Critical):**\nThis is a fundamental cultural rule. Getting it wrong can be seen as disrespectful.\n* **Sie (formal 'you'):** Use with anyone you don't know, people older than you, in shops, restaurants, government offices, and any business context. The verb is always conjugated in the 3rd person plural form.\n  - `Wie heißen Sie?` (What is your name?)\n  - `Können Sie mir helfen?` (Can you help me?)\n* **du (informal 'you'):** Use with friends, family members, people your age in a casual setting, and children.\n  - `Wie heißt du?` (What is your name?)\n  - `Kannst du mir helfen?` (Can you help me?)\n\n**Watch Out!** Never use `du` with a police officer, a government official, or your boss (unless they explicitly invite you to).\n\n**Key Vocabulary:**\n| German | English | Usage Note |\n|---|---|---|\n| die Entschuldigung | excuse me / sorry | Use to get attention or to apologize.|\n| danke (schön/sehr) | thank you (very much) | |\n| bitte (schön/sehr) | please / you're welcome | The universal response to `danke`.|\n| ja / nein | yes / no | |\n| vielleicht | maybe | |";V001-V005;N014,N043;G001;;;30;1;"You can greet and say goodbye formally and informally, and explain why you would use 'Sie' with a shopkeeper.";The verb for formal 'Sie' is always the same as the infinitive form (e.g., `kommen` -> `Sie kommen`). This is an easy way to sound polite even if you don't know the full conjugation yet.;The German word for 'glove' is 'Handschuh', which literally translates to 'hand shoe'. German is famous for these logical (and sometimes funny) compound nouns.;In Germany, you wait to be invited to use 'du'. Someone of higher status or age will typically offer it by saying, ""Wir können uns duzen"" (We can say 'du' to each other). When in doubt, always start with 'Sie'.;You've just learned the most important rule of German politeness. This knowledge is more valuable than knowing 50 words. Well done!
2;Identity & Core Verbs;Who Am I? Who Are You?;Today's lesson is the key to describing existence. We'll master the two most important verbs in the German language: `sein` (to be) and `haben` (to have). They are completely irregular, but they are so frequent that learning them by heart is non-negotiable.;"**80/20 Focus:** Knowing `ich bin` (I am), `er/sie/es ist` (he/she/it is), `ich habe` (I have), and `er/sie/es hat` (he/she/it has) will allow you to form basic descriptive sentences about yourself, others, and what you possess.\n\n**1. The Verb `sein` (to be) - Irregular Conjugation:**\n`sein` is used for identity, characteristics, and location. It must be memorized perfectly.\n| Pronoun | `sein` | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| ich | **bin** | Ich bin aus Deutschland. |\n| du | **bist** | Du bist Student. |\n| er/sie/es | **ist** | Sie ist Ärztin. |\n| wir | **sind** | Wir sind hier. |\n| ihr | **seid** | Ihr seid nett. |\n| sie/Sie | **sind** | Sie sind pünktlich. |\n\n**2. The Verb `haben` (to have) - Irregular Conjugation:**\n`haben` is used for possession and for certain fixed expressions.\n| Pronoun | `haben` | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| ich | **habe** | Ich habe ein Auto. |\n| du | **hast** | Du hast Zeit. |\n| er/sie/es | **hat** | Er hat eine Frage. |\n| wir | **haben** | Wir haben Durst. |\n| ihr | **habt** | Habt ihr Geld? |\n| sie/Sie | **haben** | Sie haben Glück. |\n\n**Watch Out!** A very common mistake is to translate ""I am hungry"" as ""Ich bin hungrig"". While technically correct, 99% of Germans will say `Ich habe Hunger.` (I have hunger). The same applies to `Durst` (thirst).";V006,V012,V016;N011,N266,N267;G008;;Day 1;35;2;"You can conjugate 'sein' and 'haben' for all pronouns from memory and use them in sentences to describe states and possessions.";The `wir sind` and `sie/Sie sind` forms of 'sein' are identical. Likewise, `wir haben` and `sie/Sie haben` are identical and match the infinitive. Use this to simplify your learning!;The German expression for ""I am hungry"" is `Ich habe Hunger` (I have hunger). The same applies to thirst: `Ich habe Durst`. You *possess* hunger and thirst, you are not defined by them.;In Germany, when someone sneezes, you say `Gesundheit!` which literally means 'Health!'. It's a way of wishing them well and is considered polite.;Mastering 'sein' and 'haben' is like getting the keys to the kingdom. You will use them in almost every conversation from now on. Don't just learn them, *know* them.
3;Nouns & The Nominative Case;The World of Der, Die, Das;Every German noun has a gender: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. This gender is a grammatical property that you must memorize with the noun. It determines the form of the articles ('the', 'a/an') that accompany it. Today we focus on the Nominative case, the case for the subject of a sentence.;"**80/20 Focus:** Do not try to find logic in the gender of objects. Instead, always learn the noun *with* its article as a single vocabulary item (e.g., learn 'der Tisch', not just 'Tisch').\n\n**1. Grammatical Gender & Definite Articles (`the`):**\n| Gender | Article | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| Masculine | **der** | `der Stuhl` (the chair) |\n| Feminine | **die** | `die Lampe` (the lamp) |\n| Neuter | **das** | `das Buch` (the book) |\n\n**2. The Nominative Case (The Subject):**\nThe Nominative case answers the question `Wer oder Was?` (Who or What?) is doing the action.\n* `Der Hund` bellt. (The dog barks.) -> **Wer** bellt? `Der Hund`.\n* `Das Auto` ist schnell. (The car is fast.) -> **Was** ist schnell? `Das Auto`.\n\n**3. Indefinite Articles (`a/an`) in the Nominative:**\n* Masculine: `ein` -> `Das ist ein Tisch.`\n* Feminine: `eine` -> `Das ist eine Tasse.`\n* Neuter: `ein` -> `Das ist ein Fenster.`\n\n**Watch Out!** Masculine and Neuter indefinite articles are the same (`ein`). You can only tell the noun's true gender if you have memorized it or see the definite article (`der`/`das`).";N002,N003,N004,N035;G003,G004;;Day 2;35;2;"You can correctly assign 'der/die/das' and 'ein/eine' to a list of common nouns and explain that the Nominative case is used for the subject.";Nouns ending in `-ung` (die Rechnung), `-heit` (die Freiheit), `-keit` (die Möglichkeit), `-schaft` (die Freundschaft), `-ei` (die Bäckerei) are almost always feminine (`die`). This is a very reliable shortcut!;The word `das Mädchen` (the girl) is neuter, not feminine. This is because the `-chen` suffix, which means 'little', automatically makes any noun neuter. So she is grammatically a 'little maid'.;The gender of a noun has nothing to do with the physical properties of the object itself. It's a purely grammatical concept. A chair is masculine, a lamp is feminine, and a girl is neuter. Accept it and move on!;This might seem strange now, but soon 'der, die, das' will feel completely natural to you. Every learner goes through this phase of confusion.
4;Regular Verbs;Putting a Sentence in Motion;Today we learn the blueprint for the vast majority of German verbs. By learning the standard conjugation pattern for regular ('weak') verbs, you unlock the ability to talk about thousands of actions in the present tense.;"**80/20 Focus:** The endings for `ich` (-e), `du` (-st), and `er/sie/es` (-t) are the most common in conversation. Master these first, as they show the most variation.\n\n**The Regular Verb Conjugation Pattern:**\nAll regular verbs follow a simple two-step process in the present tense:\n1.  **Find the stem:** Drop the `-en` ending from the infinitive verb. (e.g., `lernen` -> `lern-`, `machen` -> `mach-`)\n2.  **Add the correct personal ending:**\n| Pronoun | Ending | Example (`wohnen`) |\n|---|---|---|\n| ich | **-e** | ich wohn**e** in Berlin. |\n| du | **-st** | du wohn**st** in Berlin. |\n| er/sie/es | **-t** | er wohn**t** in Berlin. |\n| wir | **-en** | wir wohn**en** in Berlin. |\n| ihr | **-t** | ihr wohn**t** in Berlin. |\n| sie/Sie | **-en** | sie wohn**en** in Berlin. |\n\n**Watch Out! (Spelling Exception):**\nIf the verb stem ends in `-d` or `-t` (like `arbeiten` -> `arbeit-`), you must add an extra `-e-` before the `-st` and `-t` endings to make it pronounceable.\n* `du arbeitest` (NOT `arbeitst`)\n* `er arbeitet` (NOT `arbeitt`)";V008,V009,V018;;G005;;Day 3;35;2;"You can conjugate any regular verb, including those with stems ending in -t or -d, for all personal pronouns.";Chant the endings like a rhythm: **E - ST - T - EN - T - EN**. Say it ten times. It's the heartbeat of German verbs!;Many German verbs have been adopted into English. For example, `googeln` (to Google) conjugates as `ich google`, `du googelst`, `er googelt`. Other examples include `downloaden` and `chatten`.;The `ihr` form (`ihr wohnt`) is used when speaking to a group of people you know well (friends, children). It's the plural of `du`.;You've just learned a pattern that applies to thousands of verbs. This is a massive leap forward in your ability to communicate!
5;Sentence Structure;The Golden Rule: Verb at Position 2;This is the most important rule for building German sentences. In a simple statement (not a question), the conjugated verb is the anchor that always holds the second position. Master this, and your sentences will immediately sound structured and correct.;"**80/20 Focus:** For simple statements, always think: **Subject - Verb - Other stuff**. This basic structure (`Ich lerne Deutsch`) is your foundation. But also practice inverting it: **Time - Verb - Subject - Other stuff** (`Heute lerne ich Deutsch`).\n\n**The V2 (Verb-Second) Rule Explained in Detail:**\nThe 'second position' does not mean the second word, but the second 'idea' or 'element' in the sentence.\n* **Element 1: Subject**\n  - `Ich` (Pos 1) `gehe` (Pos 2) `heute ins Kino.` (I am going to the cinema today.)\n* **Element 1: Time**\n  - `Heute` (Pos 1) `gehe` (Pos 2) `ich ins Kino.` (Today I am going to the cinema.)\n* **Element 1: Place**\n  - `In Deutschland` (Pos 1) `spricht` (Pos 2) `man Deutsch.` (In Germany, one speaks German.)\n* **Element 1: Manner**\n  - `Gern` (Pos 1) `spiele` (Pos 2) `ich Tennis.` (I like to play tennis.)\n\n**Watch Out!** When an element other than the subject is in Position 1, the subject MUST move to come directly after the verb (Position 3). This is called **inversion**.";V011,V017;N005,N006;G002;;Day 4;30;3;"You can create sentences starting with a subject, a time phrase, or a place, and correctly place both the verb and the subject.";Think of the sentence as a train. The engine (the conjugated verb) is *always* the second car. You can change the first car (subject, time, place), but the engine's position is fixed.;Because of the strict V2 rule and the case system, German word order can be much more flexible than English. You can move parts of the sentence around to create different emphasis, which is a powerful tool in storytelling.;The V2 rule applies to statements. It changes for questions (verb moves to position 1) and in dependent clauses (verb moves to the end). But for now, cement this rule in your mind.;This is a grammar superpower. If you get the V2 rule right, Germans will understand you even if you make mistakes with articles or endings. It provides the core structure.
6;The Accusative Case;The Direct Object;When a noun is the direct recipient of an action (the 'direct object'), it goes into the Accusative case. This is our first case change, and it's the most common one you'll use. It answers the question `Wen oder Was?` (Whom or What?).;"**80/20 Focus:** The only article that changes is the **masculine** one. `der` becomes `den`. `ein` becomes `einen`. `kein` becomes `keinen`. Memorizing this single change is 80% of the work for this case.\n\n**The Accusative Case Declension:**\nTo find the direct object, ask ""Who or what is being 'verbed'?""\n| Gender | Nominative (Subject) | Accusative (Direct Object) | Example |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Masculine | **der** Stuhl / **ein** Stuhl | **den** Stuhl / **einen** Stuhl | Ich kaufe **den** Stuhl. |\n| Feminine | **die** Lampe / **eine** Lampe | **die** Lampe / **eine** Lampe | Ich sehe **die** Lampe. |\n| Neuter | **das** Buch / **ein** Buch | **das** Buch / **ein** Buch | Ich lese **ein** Buch. |\n\n**Common Verbs that take an Accusative Object:**\n`haben` (to have), `sehen` (to see), `kaufen` (to buy), `lesen` (to read), `essen` (to eat), `trinken` (to drink), `brauchen` (to need), `suchen` (to look for), `finden` (to find).";V012;N007,N008;G006;;Day 5;30;3;"You can identify the direct object and apply the masculine accusative change for definite, indefinite, and negative articles.";Remember the 'N' for accusative: only the masculi**N**e article gets an **N** at the e**N**d of 'de**n**' / 'eine**n**' / 'keine**n**'.;English still has remnants of the accusative case in its pronouns: we say 'He sees me' (not 'I'), and 'I see him' (not 'he'). You've been using cases your whole life without thinking about it!;The accusative case is crucial for talking about what you have, see, buy, read, eat, or drink. It's one of the most common cases in daily conversation.;Don't be intimidated by the word 'case'. For now, it's just one simple change: `der` to `den`. You can handle that! It's a small change with a big impact.
7;Asking Questions;Getting the Information You Need;Let's learn how to ask for information. There are two fundamental types of questions in German, and both have simple, predictable structures based on the V2 rule we already know.;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn `Wer?` (Who?), `Was?` (What?), `Wo?` (Where?), and `Wie?` (How?). These four 'W-Fragen' will allow you to ask most of the important questions as a beginner.\n\n**1. W-Fragen (Information Questions):**\nThese use a question word (most start with 'W'). The verb stays in Position 2.\n**Structure: W-Word (Pos 1) + Verb (Pos 2) + Subject + ...**\n* `Wo ist der Bahnhof?` (Where is the train station?)\n* `Was machst du heute?` (What are you doing today?)\n* `Wer bist du?` (Who are you?)\n* `Wie heißt du?` (What is your name? lit. How are you called?)\n* `Wann beginnt der Film?` (When does the film begin?)\n\n**2. Ja/Nein Fragen (Yes/No Questions):**\nThese are questions that can be answered with 'yes' or 'no'. The verb moves to the front.\n**Structure: Verb (Pos 1) + Subject + ...**\n* `Lernst du Deutsch?` (Are you learning German?)\n* `Ist das ein Tisch?` (Is that a table?)\n* `Haben Sie Zeit?` (Do you have time?)";V013,V014,V015;;G014,G015;;Day 6;30;2;"You can correctly form both a W-Frage (with the verb in Pos 2) and a Ja/Nein Frage (with the verb in Pos 1).";For Yes/No questions, the verb is so excited to ask, it jumps to the very front of the line! For W-Fragen, the verb stubbornly stays in its favorite spot, Position 2.;The German word for 'why' is `warum`. A common, slightly informal way to answer is with `darum`, which literally means 'therefore' but is used like 'just because!' It's a bit cheeky.;Asking questions is a learning superpower. It allows you to control the conversation and get the information you need to understand the world around you. Don't be afraid to ask!;You're now moving from just making statements to having real, two-way conversations. This is a massive step in your language journey!
8;Negation;The Power of 'No';Saying 'no' is just as important as saying 'yes'. German has two main words for negation: `nicht` and `kein`. Learning which one to use is a simple but critical rule that will make your language much more precise.;"**80/20 Focus:** Use `kein` for nouns that could have 'a/an' (ein/eine) in front of them. Use `nicht` for everything else (verbs, adjectives, specific nouns).\n\n**1. Using `kein` (not a / no / not any):**\n`kein` is a **negative article**. It is used to negate a noun that is indefinite (i.e., has no article or an indefinite article).\n* `Ich habe einen Hund.` -> `Ich habe keinen Hund.` (I don't have a dog.)\n* `Das ist eine Katze.` -> `Das ist keine Katze.` (That is not a cat.)\n* `Ich esse Fleisch.` -> `Ich esse kein Fleisch.` (I don't eat meat.)\n**Important:** `kein` gets endings just like `ein`! It must be declined for case and gender.\n\n**2. Using `nicht` (not):**\n`nicht` is an **adverb**. It is used to negate almost everything else.\n* **Verbs:** `Ich schlafe.` -> `Ich schlafe nicht.` (It usually comes after the verb).\n* **Adjectives:** `Das Auto ist neu.` -> `Das Auto ist nicht neu.`\n* **Adverbs:** `Er fährt schnell.` -> `Er fährt nicht schnell.`\n* **Specific Nouns (with 'der', 'mein', etc.):** `Das ist nicht mein Auto.`\n* **Prepositional Phrases:** `Ich komme nicht aus England.`";V016;N009,N010;G007;;Day 7;35;3;"You can correctly choose between 'nicht' and 'kein' and place them correctly in a sentence.";If you can replace 'not' with 'not a/an' in the English sentence, you almost always need `kein`. If not, you need `nicht`. This simple test works most of the time.;In the Berlin dialect, `nicht` is often pronounced and written as `nich` or `nicht`. You might hear ""Ick wees nich"" instead of ""Ich weiß nicht"".;`Kein` is a 'negative article' and behaves like one. `Nicht` is an adverb and behaves differently. Understanding this grammatical distinction is the key to mastering negation.;You now have the power to disagree, refuse, and correct information. Your communication skills just doubled in flexibility.
9;Irregular Verbs;Verbs That Break the Rules;While most verbs are regular, many of the most common ones are 'strong' or irregular. They often change their stem vowel in the present tense. Learning them by heart is crucial because you will see and use them constantly.;"**80/20 Focus:** Master `sprechen` (to speak), `sehen` (to see), `lesen` (to read), `fahren` (to drive/go), `geben` (to give), and `nehmen` (to take). These are incredibly common.\n\n**The Vowel Change Pattern:**\nThe irregularity usually only happens in the **`du`** and **`er/sie/es`** forms. The other forms are often regular!\n\n**1. Pattern e -> i:**\n| Infinitive | du-form | er/sie/es-form |\n|---|---|---|\n| sprechen | du sprichst | er spricht |\n| geben | du gibst | er gibt |\n| helfen | du hilfst | er hilft |\n| nehmen | du nimmst | er nimmt | (also has consonant change)\n\n**2. Pattern e -> ie:**\n| Infinitive | du-form | er/sie/es-form |\n|---|---|---|\n| sehen | du siehst | er sieht |\n| lesen | du liest | er liest |\n\n**3. Pattern a -> ä (Umlaut):**\n| Infinitive | du-form | er/sie/es-form |\n|---|---|---|\n| fahren | du fährst | er fährt |\n| schlafen | du schläfst | er schläft |\n| waschen | du wäschst | er wäscht |";V011,V017;N009;G009;;Day 4;35;3;"You can conjugate the most common irregular verbs for all pronouns, especially the 'du' and 'er/sie/es' forms.";The vowel change only applies to `du` and `er/sie/es`. Think of them as a rebellious pair that likes to be different. The `wir`, `ihr`, and `sie/Sie` forms almost always follow the regular pattern.;Many of these vowel changes in German have echoes in English. For example, the past tense of 'give' is 'gave', showing a similar historical vowel shift.;Don't get discouraged! The number of irregular verbs is limited, and they are so common that you'll learn them through pure repetition. You don't need to 'study' them as much as 'use' them.;This is a perfect example of the 80/20 rule. These few dozen irregular verbs make up a huge percentage of daily verb usage.
10;Modal Verbs I;Ability, Desire, and Politeness;Modal verbs (`können`, `wollen`, `müssen`, etc.) are helper verbs that change the meaning of another verb. They express ability, desire, or obligation. They are incredibly powerful and common.;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn `können` (can), `wollen` (to want), and the polite form `möchten` (would like). They cover most situations of ability and desire.\n\n**The Sentence Structure:**\nModal verbs have a fixed sentence structure:\n1. The **modal verb** is conjugated and goes in **Position 2**.\n2. The **main verb** goes to the **very end** of the sentence in its infinitive form.\n* Example: `Ich kann gut singen.` (I can sing well.)\n\n**Conjugation (they are irregular!):**\nA key feature of modal verbs is that the `ich` and `er/sie/es` forms are identical.\n| Verb | ich-form | er/sie/es-form |\n|---|---|---|\n| können | ich **kann** | er **kann** |\n| wollen | ich **will** | er **will** |\n| möchten | ich **möchte** | er **möchte** |\n\n**Politeness is Key: `wollen` vs. `möchten`**\n`Ich will` can sound childish or demanding ('I want!'). It's often more polite to use `Ich möchte...` ('I would like...').\n* In a restaurant: `Ich möchte einen Kaffee, bitte.` (Polite)\n* With a friend: `Ich will heute Abend ins Kino gehen.` (Okay, expresses strong desire)";V023,V024,V046;;G010;;Day 5;35;3;"You can form a sentence using 'können', 'wollen', or 'möchten' with the second verb correctly at the end, and explain when to use 'möchten' for politeness.";The main verb gets kicked to the end of the sentence. Imagine the modal verb is a VIP that needs the second spot, so the other verb has to go to the back of the line.;The English word 'can' is also a modal verb and follows a similar pattern: ""I can **go**."" The main verb 'go' is also in its base form. The two languages are closely related!;`möchten` is technically the subjunctive (past) form of `mögen` (to like). Using this 'unreal' form is what makes it sound more polite and less direct.;With modal verbs, you can now express nuances like ability, desire, and politeness. Your communication is becoming much more sophisticated.
11;Possessive Articles;My, Your, His, Her;Time to claim ownership! Possessive articles (`my`, `your`, etc.) are essential for talking about your family, your things, and your life. They behave very much like the indefinite article 'ein' and must be declined.;"**80/20 Focus:** Master `mein` (my) and `dein` (your, informal) in the Nominative and Accusative cases. This covers 90% of what you'll talk about initially.\n\n**1. The Possessive Articles:**\n`ich` -> `mein` | `wir` -> `unser`\n`du` -> `dein` | `ihr` -> `euer`\n`er/es` -> `sein` (his/its) | `sie/Sie` -> `ihr`/`Ihr` (their/your formal)\n`sie` -> `ihr` (her)\n\n**2. Declension: It follows `ein`!**\nThe endings for possessive articles are exactly the same as for `ein` and `kein`.\n| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Nom. | mein Hund | mein**e** Katze | mein Buch | mein**e** Bücher|\n| Acc. | mein**en** Hund | mein**e** Katze | mein Buch | mein**e** Bücher|\n\n**Example Sentences:**\n* `Das ist mein Bruder.` (Nom, masc)\n* `Siehst du meine Tasche?` (Acc, fem)\n* `Er hat seinen Schlüssel verloren.` (Acc, masc)";V021,V022;N011,N012;G012;;Day 3, 6;35;3;"You can use 'mein' and 'dein' correctly in nominative and accusative sentences, with the right endings for gender.";The ending on the possessive article depends on the gender/case of the noun it describes, NOT the gender of the owner. Her dog is `ihr Hund`, not `ihre Hund`.;The word `euer` (your plural) is tricky. When it gets an ending, it often drops the middle 'e': `eure Tasche` (your bag).;`Ihr/ihr` is a tricky one. It can mean 'her', 'their', or 'your (formal)'. The capitalization and context are your only clues. Don't worry, even Germans get confused sometimes if the context isn't clear!;Being able to talk about what belongs to you (`mein Haus`) or others (`sein Auto`) makes your language much more personal and descriptive.
12;The Dative Case;The Indirect Object;Welcome to your third case! The Dative case is typically used for the indirect object – the person or thing that *receives* the direct object. It answers the question, ""To whom?"" (`Wem?`) or ""For whom?"".;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn the article changes and recognize the dative as the 'receiver' in sentences with `geben` (to give), `schenken` (to gift), and `zeigen` (to show). Also learn the key dative verb `helfen` (to help).\n\n**1. Dative Case Declension:**\nThis time, all articles change. This is a big step!\n| Gender | Nominative | Dative | Example |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Masculine | der / ein | **dem / einem** | Ich gebe **dem Mann** ein Buch.|\n| Feminine | die / eine | **der / einer** | Ich helfe **der Frau**. |\n| Neuter | das / ein | **dem / einem** | Das Auto gehört **dem Kind**.|\n| Plural | die / - | **den / -** (+n) | Ich spiele mit **den Kindern**.|\n\n**2. Verbs that Always Take Dative:**\nSome verbs' objects are always in the Dative case.\n* `helfen` (to help): `Kannst du mir helfen?` (`mir` is dative 'me')\n* `danken` (to thank): `Ich danke Ihnen.` (`Ihnen` is dative 'you' formal)\n* `gefallen` (to be pleasing to): `Das Kleid gefällt mir.` (The dress pleases me -> I like the dress.)\n* `schmecken` (to taste good to): `Die Pizza schmeckt uns.` (The pizza tastes good to us.)";V025,V026;N002,N003;G016;;Day 6;35;4;"You can identify the dative noun in a sentence, know the correct article changes, and use the verb 'helfen' with a dative pronoun.";Chant the dative articles: `dem, der, dem, den... plus n`. The feminine `die` becomes `der`, which is a common trap!;'Mir gefällt...' is a very common way to say you like something visually, like clothes or a city. 'Es schmeckt mir' is the standard way to say something tastes good.;In a German sentence with both an accusative and a dative object, the dative object usually comes first if it's a pronoun: `Ich gebe es (Acc) dir (Dat).` vs. `Ich gebe dem Mann (Dat) das Buch (Acc).` This is an advanced topic, but good to know.;This is a major milestone. Understanding the dative case is essential for forming more complex and natural-sounding sentences. It separates the beginner from the intermediate learner.
13;Dative Prepositions;Prepositions that Demand Dative;Some prepositions are bullies. They don't care about the rest of the sentence; they ALWAYS demand the Dative case for the noun that follows them. Memorizing them is a direct path to using the Dative correctly.;"**80/20 Focus:** Memorize `mit` (with), `nach` (to/after), `von` (from), and `zu` (to). These are used constantly in daily speech and are almost guaranteed to appear on an A1 test.\n\n**The Core Dative Prepositions:**\n* `aus` - from, out of (origin)\n* `bei` - at, near, with (at someone's place)\n* `mit` - with, by (means of transport)\n* `nach` - to (cities/countries), after (time)\n* `seit` - since, for (a period of time continuing to now)\n* `von` - from, of\n* `zu` - to (people, places, direction)\n* `gegenüber` - opposite\n\n**How they work:**\nIf you see one of these words, the noun phrase that follows **must** be in the Dative case.\n* `Ich spreche mit dem Mann.` (I'm speaking with the man.)\n* `Er kommt aus der Schweiz.` (He comes from Switzerland.)\n* `Wir fahren zu meinen Eltern.` (We are driving to my parents.)\n\n**Contractions:** `zu + dem` -> `zum`; `zu + der` -> `zur`; `von + dem` -> `vom`";V032,V033,V034;;G017;;Day 12;30;4;"You can use 'mit', 'nach', 'von', and 'zu' correctly with a dative article and form contractions like 'zum' and 'zur'.";Learn the prepositions to the tune of the 'Blue Danube Waltz': `aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu` - they always take the dative, ooh ooh ooh!;The German word `Gift` means 'poison', not 'gift'! The word for a gift/present is `das Geschenk`.;`nach` is used for going to cities and countries without an article (`nach Deutschland`). `zu` is used for going to people or specific buildings (`zum Supermarkt`). `in` is used when you're going *inside* something.;This is a fantastic shortcut. By memorizing this small list of words, you know for sure you need to use the Dative case. No guesswork required!
14;Separable Prefix Verbs;Verbs That Split in Two;Some German verbs can be split in two! The prefix breaks off and goes to the end of the sentence. This seems strange at first but is a very common and logical pattern in German that allows for the creation of many new verbs.;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn the pattern with high-frequency verbs: `anrufen` (to call up), `einkaufen` (to shop), and `aufstehen` (to get up). Recognizing this pattern is key.\n\n**The Structure:**\n1. The verb stem is conjugated and stays in its normal position (usually Position 2).\n2. The prefix goes to the very **end** of the clause.\n\n* **`anrufen`** -> `Ich rufe dich morgen an.` (I will call you tomorrow.)\n* **`einkaufen`** -> `Sie kauft im Supermarkt ein.` (She is shopping in the supermarket.)\n* **`fernsehen`** -> `Er sieht jeden Abend fern.` (He watches TV every evening.)\n\n**Common Separable Prefixes:**\n* `an-` (at, on) -> `ankommen` (to arrive)\n* `auf-` (up, open) -> `aufmachen` (to open)\n* `aus-` (out) -> `aussehen` (to look, appear)\n* `ein-` (in, into) -> `einladen` (to invite)\n* `mit-` (with, along) -> `mitkommen` (to come along)\n* `vor-` (before, forward) -> `vorlesen` (to read out loud)";V027,V028,V029;;G015;;Day 5;30;3;"You can form a sentence with a separable verb, putting the prefix at the end, and recognize common separable prefixes.";The prefix is like a boomerang. You say the main part of the verb, but you throw the prefix to the end of the sentence.;When used with a modal verb (`können`, `müssen`...), the separable verb comes back together at the end! `Ich will dich anrufen.` (I want to call you.) The modal verb boots the *entire* re-joined verb to the end.;The prefix often changes the verb's meaning in a logical way. `kaufen` is 'to buy', but `ein-kaufen` is 'to do the shopping'. `sehen` is 'to see', but `fern-sehen` is 'to watch TV' (literally 'far-see').;This might feel like the strangest rule yet, but it's a core part of German. Once you get the rhythm of throwing the prefix to the end, it becomes second nature.
15;The Perfekt Tense with 'haben';How to Talk About the Past;How do you talk about what you did yesterday? In spoken German, you almost always use the 'Perfekt' tense. It's formed with a helping verb (`haben` or `sein`) and a past participle.;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn the structure and how to form the past participle for regular verbs. This will let you talk about a huge range of past actions.\n\n**1. The Structure (with `haben`):**\nThis is just like the modal verb structure!\n1. The helping verb `haben` is conjugated and goes in **Position 2**.\n2. The **Past Participle** (the actual past action) goes to the **end** of the sentence.\n* Example: `Ich habe Deutsch gelernt.` (I learned/have learned German.)\n\n**2. Making the Past Participle:**\n* **Regular (Weak) Verbs:** **`ge-` + verb stem + `-t`**\n  - `machen` -> `gemacht` (made/done) -> `Ich habe meine Hausaufgaben gemacht.`\n  - `spielen` -> `gespielt` (played) -> `Er hat Fußball gespielt.`\n* **Irregular (Strong) Verbs:** Often **`ge-` + stem (with vowel change) + `-en`**\n  - `sprechen` -> `gesprochen` (spoken) -> `Wir haben Deutsch gesprochen.`\n  - `trinken` -> `getrunken` (drunk) -> `Hast du den Kaffee getrunken?`\n\n**Watch Out! (No `ge-` prefix):**\n* Verbs ending in `-ieren`: `studieren` -> `studiert`. (`Ich habe studiert.`)\n* Verbs with inseparable prefixes (`be-`, `er-`, `ver-`...): `besuchen` -> `besucht`. (`Ich habe meine Oma besucht.`)\n";V030,V031;;G011,G013;;Day 9, 10;40;3;"You can form a past sentence for regular and common irregular verbs, and know the exceptions for verbs ending in '-ieren'.";Think of the past participle as a 'past-tense nugget'. The `ge-` prefix is the crunchy breading. `ge-lern-t`.;While English makes a distinction between 'I learned' (simple past) and 'I have learned' (present perfect), spoken German uses the Perfekt tense for almost all past actions. The simple past (`Präteritum`) is mostly for formal writing and stories.;This structure is incredibly useful. Once you learn a new past participle, you can immediately use it in conversation just by plugging it into the `Ich habe ... gemacht` formula.;You can now officially talk about your past! This opens up a whole new world of stories you can tell and understand.
16;Two-Way Prepositions;Location vs. Direction;These nine prepositions are chameleons. They can take EITHER the Accusative OR the Dative case, and the case you choose changes the meaning of the sentence from 'where to?' to 'where at?'. This is a core concept of German.;"**80/20 Focus:** Master the core concept with `in` (in), `an` (on/at), and `auf` (on top of). The question you ask determines the case.\n\n**The Golden Rule:**\n* Ask **`Wohin?`** (Where to?) -> implies **Direction/Movement** -> Use the **Accusative** case.\n* Ask **`Wo?`** (Where at?) -> implies static **Location/Position** -> Use the **Dative** case.\n\n**The Two-Way Prepositions:** `in`, `an` (at/on vertical surface), `auf` (on horizontal surface), `über` (over), `unter` (under), `vor` (in front of), `hinter` (behind), `neben` (next to), `zwischen` (between)\n\n**Detailed Example with `auf`:**\n* Direction (Accusative): `Ich lege das Buch auf den Tisch.` (I lay the book *onto* the table.) -> `Wohin?`\n* Location (Dative): `Das Buch liegt auf dem Tisch.` (The book is lying *on* the table.) -> `Wo?`\n\n**Common Contractions:**\n* Dative: `in + dem` -> `im`; `an + dem` -> `am`\n* Accusative: `in + das` -> `ins`; `an + das` -> `ans`";V007,V037,V038;;G018;;Day 6, 12;35;4;"You can explain the Wohin/Wo difference and correctly form sentences with 'in', 'an', and 'auf' in both Accusative and Dative.";Accusative has an 'A' for Action and movement. Dative is for a 'Dot on a map', a fixed location.;Germans are very precise about this. This rule eliminates ambiguity that exists in English. 'The boy is running in the house' could mean he is running around inside (Dative) or running from outside to inside (Accusative). German makes you choose!;These prepositions are extremely common. Mastering this concept is a sign that you are moving from a beginner to an intermediate level of thinking in German.;This is a tough concept, but it's incredibly logical. Once it 'clicks', you will feel like you've unlocked a secret level of German grammar.
17;The Perfekt Tense with 'sein';Verbs of Motion and Change;Some verbs don't use `haben` to form the past tense. They use `sein`. This happens with verbs that show movement from point A to point B, or a change of state (like waking up or being born).;"**80/20 Focus:** The most common verbs using `sein` are verbs of motion: `gehen` (to go), `fahren` (to drive/travel), and `fliegen` (to fly). Also, memorize the exceptions `sein` and `bleiben`.\n\n**The Rule:** Use `sein` (conjugated) instead of `haben` for certain verbs.\n\n**The Structure:**\n1. The helping verb `sein` is conjugated and goes in **Position 2**.\n2. The **Past Participle** goes to the **end** of the sentence.\n* Example: `Ich bin nach Hause gegangen.` (I went home.) **NOT** `ich habe gegangen`.\n\n**Verbs with `sein` Fall into 2 Categories (+ 2 exceptions):**\n1.  **A-to-B Motion:** `gehen` (gegangen), `fahren` (gefahren), `fliegen` (geflogen), `kommen` (gekommen), `reisen` (gereist), `laufen` (gelaufen)\n2.  **Change of State:** `aufstehen` (aufgestanden - to get up), `einschlafen` (eingeschlafen - to fall asleep), `wachsen` (gewachsen - to grow), `sterben` (gestorben - to die)\n3.  **The Exceptions:** `sein` (gewesen - to be) and `bleiben` (geblieben - to stay)";V017,V041,V042;;G012;;Day 15;30;4;"You know to say 'Ich bin gegangen' (not 'ich habe gegangen') and can list the types of verbs that use 'sein'.";If the verb involves your whole body moving from one location to another, you probably need `sein`. Think 'Go-verbs get Sein'.;`bleiben` (to stay) is a tricky one. Even though it implies a lack of motion, it's considered a 'change of state' (from moving to staying) and thus uses `sein`. `Ich bin zu Hause geblieben.` (I stayed at home.);The distinction between `haben` and `sein` in the past tense is a feature German shares with other languages like French (`être`) and Italian (`essere`).;You can now correctly describe journeys and changes. 'Yesterday I drove to the mountains' is a sentence you can now build perfectly.
18;Modal Verbs II;Obligation and Permission;Let's complete our set of essential modal verbs with `müssen` (must/to have to), `sollen` (should/ought to), and `dürfen` (may/to be allowed to).;"**80/20 Focus:** `müssen` (must) for necessity and `dürfen` (may) for permission are extremely common in daily rules and interactions.\n\n**The Structure:** Same as before! Modal in pos 2, infinitive at the end.\n\n**Conjugation (ich/er/sie/es forms are identical):**\n| Verb | ich-form | er/sie/es-form | Meaning |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| müssen | ich **muss** | er **muss** | must, have to (necessity) |\n| sollen | ich **soll** | er **soll** | should, supposed to (obligation/advice) |\n| dürfen | ich **darf** | er **darf** | may, be allowed to (permission) |\n\n**Crucial Difference in Negation:**\n* `nicht müssen` -> 'to **not have to**' (optional)\n  - `Du musst nicht abwaschen.` (You don't have to do the dishes.)\n* `nicht dürfen` -> 'to be **forbidden/must not**' (prohibition)\n  - `Du darfst hier nicht rauchen.` (You must not smoke here.)";V035,V036,V039;;G010;;Day 10;30;3;"You can use 'müssen', 'sollen', and 'dürfen', and explain the critical difference between 'nicht müssen' and 'nicht dürfen'.";`dürfen` has a `d` like a door. It's often about permission to go through the door. `müssen` sounds like 'must' - they both start with 'mu'. `sollen` sounds like 'should'.;A common question from a German parent to a child might be: `Musst du das machen oder sollst du das machen?` (Do you have to do that, or are you just supposed to do that?) to find out if the child is acting on their own or on someone else's orders.;In Germany, signs often use `dürfen` or its negation. `Hier dürfen Sie nicht parken!` (You may not park here!) is a common sign.;You can now understand and express rules, obligations, and permissions. This is crucial for navigating daily life in Germany.
19;The Imperative;Giving Commands and Instructions;Let's get bossy (or just helpful!). The imperative is the mood used to give commands, make suggestions, or provide instructions. It's very direct and useful, and each pronoun (`du`, `ihr`, `Sie`) has its own form.;"**80/20 Focus:** The informal `du` command is the most common and useful for everyday interactions. Master its formation, including for irregular verbs.\n\n**Forming Commands:**\n1.  **`du` (informal, to one person):**\n    * **Regular verbs:** Take the verb stem. That's it! `machen` -> `Mach!` `gehen` -> `Geh!`\n    * **Irregular verbs:** If the verb has a vowel change (e -> i/ie), keep the change. `geben` -> (du gibst) -> `Gib!` `lesen` -> (du liest) -> `Lies!`\n    * **Separable verbs:** The prefix goes to the end. `anrufen` -> `Ruf mich an!`\n2.  **`ihr` (informal, to a group):**\n    * This is the easiest one: just use the normal `ihr` form of the verb. `kommen` -> `Kommt!` `lesen` -> `Lest!`\n3.  **`Sie` (formal):**\n    * Flip the verb and pronoun from the normal statement. `kommen` -> `Kommen Sie!` `lesen` -> `Lesen Sie!`\n\n**Always add `bitte` (please) to be polite!** `Geben Sie mir bitte das Salz.` (Please give me the salt.)";V039,V040;;G019;;Day 9;25;3;"You can correctly form a command for 'du', 'ihr', and 'Sie' for both regular and common irregular verbs.";The `du` command is a 'short-cut' command. It's the shortest form, so you drop the pronoun and the `-st` ending.;The most famous command in German pop culture might be from the detective show 'Derrick', whose catchphrase was `Harry, hol schon mal den Wagen!` (Harry, go get the car!).;Being able to give and understand simple commands is essential for everything from cooking with a friend (`Gib mir das Salz!`) to navigating (`Fahren Sie geradeaus!`).;You are now able to direct action, not just describe it. This is a powerful shift in your communication ability.
20;Coordinating Conjunctions;Connecting Sentences Simply;These small words are mighty. They connect two complete sentences (main clauses) without changing the word order of the second sentence. They are the simplest way to form longer, more complex thoughts.;"**80/20 Focus:** `und` (and), `aber` (but), and `oder` (or) are the three essential connectors you will use every day. Also learn `denn` as an alternative to `weil`.\n\n**The 'Position 0' Rule (ADUSO):**\nThe coordinating conjunctions are: `aber` (but), `denn` (because), `und` (and), `sondern` (but rather), `oder` (or).\nThey sit *between* two complete sentences and are considered to be in **'Position 0'**. This means the sentence that follows them still begins its own word count, starting with the subject in Position 1 and the verb in Position 2.\n\n**Example with `aber`:**\n* `Ich will ins Kino gehen,` (Sentence 1)\n* `aber` (Position 0)\n* `ich` (Pos 1) `habe` (Pos 2) `keine Zeit.` (Sentence 2)\n\n**`denn` vs. `weil`:**\nBoth mean 'because', but `denn` is a coordinator (V2 word order), while `weil` is a subordinator (verb-final).\n* `Ich lerne Deutsch, denn ich wohne in Deutschland.`\n* `Ich lerne Deutsch, weil ich in Deutschland wohne.`";V043,V044,V045;;G021;;Day 5;25;2;"You can connect two sentences with 'und', 'aber', or 'denn' while keeping the correct V2 word order in the second clause.";Remember the acronym **ADUSO**: `Aber, Denn, Und, Sondern, Oder`. These are 'zero-position' words and don't mess up your V2 sentence structure.;`sondern` means 'but rather' and is used only after a negative statement to provide a direct correction. `Er ist nicht alt, sondern jung.` (He is not old, but rather young.);Understanding conjunctions is the first step to moving beyond simple sentences and expressing more complex relationships between ideas.;Your sentences are becoming longer and more interesting! You can now express connections and contrasts in your thoughts.
21;Subordinating Conjunctions;The 'Verb-Kicker' Rule;Now for a new, powerful word order rule! When a clause is introduced by a 'subordinating' conjunction like `weil` (because) or `dass` (that), the conjugated verb gets kicked to the very end of its own clause.;"**80/20 Focus:** `weil` (because) and `dass` (that) are the two most important subordinating conjunctions to learn at A1. They allow you to explain reasons and report what someone thinks or says.\n\n**The Verb-Final Rule:**\nIn a dependent clause (a clause introduced by a word like `weil` or `dass`), the conjugated verb moves from Position 2 to the **very end** of that clause.\n\n**Example with `weil`:**\n* `Ich kann heute nicht kommen, weil ich arbeiten muss.` (I can't come today because I have to work.)\n  - Note: The modal verb `muss` is conjugated and goes to the end.\n\n**Example with `dass` (that):**\n* `Ich denke, dass Deutsch eine interessante Sprache ist.` (I think that German is an interesting language.)\n  - The verb `ist` is kicked to the end.\n\n**Common Subordinating Conjunctions for A1:**\n`weil` (because), `dass` (that), `ob` (if/whether), `wenn` (if/when)";V052,V053;;G023;;Day 5, 10;35;4;"You can create a sentence with 'weil' or 'dass' and correctly place the conjugated verb at the very end of the clause.";`weil` and `dass` are 'verb-kickers'. They literally boot the conjugated verb to the end of their own clause. If there's a modal verb, the modal verb gets kicked to the end.;This verb-final structure can lead to very long sentences where you have to wait right until the end to find out what the action actually is! It's a key feature of formal and academic German.;The word `dass` is spelled with a double 's', while the article `das` is spelled with one 's'. A common mistake is to mix them up. `dass` is a connector, `das` refers to a neuter noun.;This is a major step towards sounding truly German. Mastering the verb-final rule is a sign of an advanced A1 / early A2 learner.
22;Let's Eat!;Ordering Food and Drink;Time to use your German in a practical, delicious setting. We'll learn vocabulary for food and drink, and the key phrases for politely ordering in a café or restaurant.;"**80/20 Focus:** The phrases `Ich hätte gern...` (I would like to have...), `Ich möchte...` (I would like...), and `Ich nehme...` (I'll take...) are the most polite and universally accepted ways to order.\n\n**Key Vocabulary:**\n| German | English | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| die Speisekarte | menu | |\n| bestellen | to order | |\n| zahlen, bitte | to pay, please | |\n| Die Rechnung, bitte | The bill, please. | |\n| das Trinkgeld | tip | |\n| Zusammen oder getrennt? | Together or separate? | They will ask this when you want to pay.|\n\n**Example Dialogue:**\n* Waiter: `Hallo! Was darf es sein?` (Hello! What can it be?)\n* You: `Guten Tag. Ich hätte gern ein Bier und das Schnitzel mit Pommes, bitte.` (Good day. I'd like a beer and the schnitzel with fries, please.)\n* (Later...)\n* You: `Entschuldigung, wir möchten bitte zahlen.` (Excuse me, we would like to pay please.)\n* Waiter: `Gerne. Zusammen oder getrennt?` (Gladly. Together or separate?)";V046,V047;N156,N086,N462;G010;;Day 10;30;2;"You can politely order a drink and a meal, ask to pay, and understand the 'zusammen/getrennt' question.";`Ich nehme...` (I'll take...) is also very common and perfectly polite for ordering food. `Ich hätte gern...` is often considered the most polite.;The legal drinking age for beer and wine in Germany is 16, and 18 for spirits. It's much more integrated into daily life than in many other countries.;Tipping (`Trinkgeld`) is appreciated but not obligatory. Rounding up the bill by 5-10% is a common practice for good service. For a €18.50 bill, you might say `Machen Sie 20` (Make it 20).;You are now ready to survive in a German restaurant! This is a skill that makes travel and social life much more enjoyable.
23;Adjective Endings I;A First Look at a Tricky Topic;This is one of the most feared parts of German grammar. When an adjective comes *before* a noun (`the red bus`), it needs an ending. We will take a gentle first look at the simplest and most common pattern.;"**80/20 Focus:** Don't try to master all endings at once. Just learn to recognize the pattern after a **definite article** (`der/die/das`). This is the 'weak' declension and it's the simplest.\n\n**The Rule:** An adjective only gets an ending when it is **before** the noun it describes. `Das Auto ist schnell.` (No ending). `Das ist ein schnelles Auto.` (Ending required).\n\n**The 'Weak' Declension (after `der`, `die`, `das`...):**\nThis pattern is surprisingly simple:\n* In the **Nominative singular** (M, F, N) AND **Accusative singular** (F, N), the ending is **-e**.\n  * `der gut**e** Mann`\n  * `die schön**e** Frau`\n  * `das klein**e** Kind`\n* **Everywhere else** (Masc. Accusative, all Dative, all Plural), the ending is **-en**.\n  * Accusative: `Ich sehe den gut**en** Mann.`\n  * Dative: `Ich helfe dem gut**en** Mann.`\n  * Plural: `Die gut**en** Kinder spielen.`";V048,V049;N008;G022;;Day 3, 6, 12;40;5;"You can explain the difference in endings between 'der rote Bus' and 'den roten Bus' and know when an adjective does not get an ending.";After a 'strong' article word (`der`, `den`, `dem`...), which already shows the gender and case clearly, the adjective can be 'weak' and take a simple `-e` or `-en` ending.;Mark Twain famously wrote an essay called 'The Awful German Language' where he hilariously complained about adjective endings. You're not alone in finding them tricky!;This topic is usually where A2 begins. Understanding the basic principle now gives you a huge head start and helps you read German better, as you'll see these endings everywhere.;Don't panic! This is an advanced topic. For A1, the goal is recognition, not perfect production. You've got this.
24;Comparative & Superlative;Bigger, Better, Faster;How do you compare things? German is very similar to English here. It uses `-er` for 'more ...' (comparative) and a special form with `am ...-sten` for 'the most ...' (superlative).;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn the basic pattern with `-er` and `am ...-sten`, and memorize the three main irregulars: `gut`, `viel`, and `gern`.\n\n**1. The Regular Pattern:**\n* **Base:** `schnell` (fast)\n* **Comparative (-er):** `schneller` (faster)\n* **Superlative (am ...-sten):** `am schnellsten` (the fastest)\nExample: `Mein Auto ist schnell, aber dein Auto ist schneller.` `Sein Auto ist am schnellsten.`\n\n**2. The Three Main Irregulars:**\n| Base | Comparative | Superlative |\n|---|---|---|\n| `gut` (good) | `besser` (better)| `am besten` (best)|\n| `viel` (much) | `mehr` (more) | `am meisten` (most)|\n| `gern` (gladly) | `lieber` (preferably) | `am liebsten` (favorite)|\n\n**3. Using `als` (than):**\nWhen making a direct comparison, use `als`.\n* `Er ist größer als ich.` (He is taller than me.)\n* `Ich trinke lieber Tee als Kaffee.` (I prefer to drink tea than coffee.)";V050,V051;;G023;;Day 23;30;3;"You can form the comparative and superlative of a regular adjective and use 'besser', 'lieber' and 'als' in correct comparison sentences.";The `-er` ending is just like English ('fastER', 'smallER'). For superlative, remember `am ...-sten` is like a sandwich: 'am' is the bread on the left, '-sten' is the bread on the right.;Many short, one-syllable adjectives also add an umlaut in the comparative/superlative. `alt` -> `älter`, `groß` -> `größer`, `jung` -> `jünger`.;Being able to say you like something (`gern`), prefer something (`lieber`), or like it the most (`am liebsten`) is a very common and natural way to express opinions in German.;You can now compare things and express preferences, making your conversations much more nuanced and interesting.
25;Hobbies & Free Time;What Do You Do for Fun?;Let's talk about something enjoyable! Learn to talk about your hobbies and what you like to do in your free time using the special German word `gern`.;"**80/20 Focus:** The most natural way to talk about liking an *activity* is to add `gern` after the verb. For liking a *thing*, use the verb `mögen`.\n\n**1. How to Express Likes:**\n* **For Actions (Verbs): Use `gern`**\n  The word `gern` comes right after the conjugated verb.\n  * `Ich lese gern.` (I like to read.)\n  * `Hörst du gern Musik?` (Do you like to listen to music?)\n  * `Wir reisen gern.` (We like to travel.)\n  * Remember the comparative forms: `gern -> lieber -> am liebsten`.\n\n* **For Things (Nouns): Use `mögen`**\n  The verb `mögen` (to like) is used when you like a specific thing. It's an irregular modal-like verb!\n  * `ich mag`, `du magst`, `er/sie/es mag`...\n  * `Ich mag Pizza.` (I like pizza.)\n  * `Magst du Hunde?` (Do you like dogs?)\n\n**Key Hobby Vocabulary:**\n`lesen`, `Musik hören`, `Sport machen`, `Freunde treffen`, `ins Kino gehen`, `kochen`, `reisen`, `schwimmen`, `wandern` (to hike)";V054,V055;N015,N016;G023;;Day 24;30;2;"You can say at least two hobbies you like using 'gern' and one thing you like using 'mögen', and ask others about their hobbies.";Think of `gern` as adding a 'happy face' 😊 to a verb. `Ich spiele.` (I play.) -> `Ich spiele gern.` (I *like* to play.);Germany has over 600,000 registered clubs (`Vereine`). There are clubs for everything from soccer (`Fußballverein`) and choir (`Gesangsverein`) to breeding rabbits (`Kaninchenzüchterverein`).;Joining a `Verein` is a huge part of social life in Germany and a fantastic way for newcomers to meet people with similar interests.;Talking about your hobbies is a great way to find common ground and make new friends. This lesson is key to social conversations!
26;Dates & Ordinal Numbers;First, Second, Third...;How to say your birthday or talk about the date. Ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are simple once you know the two patterns, and are essential for making appointments.;"**80/20 Focus:** Learn the pattern for 1-19 (`-te`) and the pattern for 20+ (`-ste`). Master how to state a date using `am ...-ten`.\n\n**1. The Rule for Ordinal Numbers:**\n* **1-19:** Add **`-te`** to the number. (e.g., `vierte`, `zehnte`)\n  * *Exceptions:* `erste` (1st), `dritte` (3rd), `siebte` (7th), `achte` (8th)\n* **20+:** Add **`-ste`** to the number. (e.g., `zwanzigste`, `dreißigste`, `hundertste`)\n\n**2. How to Say the Date:**\n* **To state what the date IS:** Use nominative `der` + ordinal + `-e`.\n  - `Heute ist der erste April.` (Today is the first of April.)\n* **To say something happens ON a date:** Use `am` (an + dem) + ordinal + `-en`.\n  - `Ich habe am zwanzigsten Mai Geburtstag.` (My birthday is on the 20th of May.)\n  - `Das Treffen ist am siebten Januar.` (The meeting is on the seventh of January.)\n\n**Asking the date:**\n* `Der Wievielte ist heute?` (What is the date today? Lit: 'The how-many-eth is it today?')";V056,V057;;G025;;Day 10;25;3;"You can state today's date and say your birthday in a full German sentence using 'am' and the correct ordinal number ending.";The `-te` ending for numbers up to 19 is like the 'th' in English. The exceptions `erste` and `dritte` sound a bit like 'first' and 'third'.;In German, dates are always written in Day.Month.Year format. So 12.07.2025 is July 12th, not December 7th. A very common point of confusion for Americans!;`Der Wievielte ist heute?` is a unique German construction. `wieviel` (how much/many) is combined with the ordinal ending `-te` to create a new question word.;You can now make appointments, understand deadlines, and most importantly, tell people when your birthday is so they can get you a `Geschenk`!
27;Giving Directions;How Do I Get There?;Combine your knowledge of commands, prepositions, and places to ask for and give simple directions. This is an incredibly practical skill for navigating any German-speaking city.;"**80/20 Focus:** Master `links` (left), `rechts` (right), and `geradeaus` (straight ahead). These three words combined with simple commands will get you almost anywhere.\n\n**1. Asking for Directions:**\n* `Entschuldigung, wie komme ich zum Bahnhof, bitte?` (Excuse me, how do I get to the train station, please?)\n* `Entschuldigung, wo ist die nächste Apotheke?` (Excuse me, where is the next pharmacy?)\n\n**2. Giving Directions (using the Imperative):**\n* `Gehen Sie immer geradeaus.` (Go straight ahead.)\n* `Biegen Sie an der Ampel links ab.` (Turn left at the traffic light.) (`abbiegen` is separable!)\n* `Nehmen Sie die zweite Straße rechts.` (Take the second street on the right.)\n\n**3. Useful Phrases:**\n* `auf der linken Seite` (on the left side)\n* `auf der rechten Seite` (on the right side)\n* `an der Ecke` (at the corner)\n* `gegenüber von` (opposite of)\n* `bis zur Kreuzung` (until the intersection)";V058,V059;N017,N018;G019;;Day 19, 18;30;3;"You can guide someone left, right, and straight ahead to a location using imperative forms and prepositions.";`links` and 'left' both start with 'L'. For `rechts`, think 'right and correct'. `geradeaus` has 'grade' in it, like a road grade you drive on.;The little green and red men on pedestrian traffic lights in Germany are called `Ampelmännchen` (little traffic light men). The design from former East Germany is particularly famous and is now a beloved cultural icon.;Even in the age of GPS, knowing how to ask for and understand directions is a vital skill. It can save you when your phone battery dies and is a great way to interact with locals.;You are now self-sufficient! You can navigate a German city on your own. What a fantastic feeling of independence.

This lesson transitions you from a pure 'learner' to someone who can actively use the language to create experiences.;Look at how much you've learned! You're combining questions, times, dates, modals, and places all into one single, practical conversation.

Think of the salutation as Position 0 of the first sentence.;The abbreviation `LG` is very common in informal texts and emails and stands for `Liebe Grüße`. Likewise, `VG` stands for `Viele Grüße`.;Emails in a German business context are much more formal. They would start with `Sehr geehrte/r Herr/Frau...` and end with `Mit freundlichen Grüßen`. That's a B1/B2 topic!;Being able to write gives you time to think and form your sentences perfectly. It's a great way to practice without the pressure of a live conversation.
30;A1 Review & Next Steps;You Did It! What's Next?;Congratulations! You have covered all the core concepts of the A1 level. Today is for reviewing the key pillars of your knowledge, consolidating what you've learned, and looking ahead to what the next level, A2, has in store.;"**80/20 A1 Review - The 5 Pillars You Mastered:**\n1.  **Word Order:** You know the verb is in **Position 2** in main clauses (`V2-Regel`), in **Position 1** in Yes/No questions, and at the **End** of dependent clauses (`weil`, `dass`).\n2.  **The Case System:** You can identify the **Nominative** (subject - `der`), **Accusative** (direct object - `den`), and **Dative** (indirect object/receiver - `dem`) and know the definite article changes for each.\n3.  **The `Perfekt` Tense:** You can talk about the past in spoken German using `haben` or `sein` as a helper verb in Position 2 and a **past participle** at the end.\n4.  **Modal Verbs:** You can use `können`, `wollen`, `müssen`, `dürfen` to express ability, desire, and obligation, kicking the main verb to the end.\n5.  **Prepositions:** You know that some prepositions always demand the Accusative (`für`), some always demand the Dative (`mit`), and some (`Two-Way` like `in`) depend on location (Dative) vs. direction (Accusative).\n\n**Looking Ahead to A2:**\nAt the A2 level, you will build on this foundation by learning:\n* More complex sentence structures (Genitive case, relative clauses)\n* More tenses (Simple Past/Präteritum, Future I)\n* A much deeper dive into adjective endings\n* Reflexive & passive verbs";;;;;All previous days;45;4;"You can confidently identify and explain the 5 pillars of A1 German grammar and feel prepared for what comes next.";The journey from A1 to B1 is often considered the hardest part.
