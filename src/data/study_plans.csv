Week,Day,Topic,Sub-Topic,Explanation (in English),German Example,English Translation,"Hints, Helps & Things to Watch Out For"
"Week 1","Day 1","Introduction","The German Alphabet & Pronunciation","Learn the 30 letters of the German alphabet, including the umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and the Eszett (ß). Focus on sounds that differ from English.","Die Straße ist schön.","The street is beautiful.","'ß' (Eszett) sounds like a sharp 'ss'. 'Str' at the beginning of a word is pronounced 'shtr'. 'ch' has two sounds: a soft one (like 'h' in 'huge') after i, e, ä, ö, ü, and a hard one (like 'k' in 'loch') after a, o, u."
"Week 1","Day 2","Nouns and Gender","Der, Die, Das","Every German noun has a gender: masculine (der), feminine (die), or neuter (das). This is grammatical gender and doesn't always relate to the object's nature.","der Tisch, die Lampe, das Buch","the table, the lamp, the book","MEMORIZE nouns with their articles from day one! There are some patterns, but many are arbitrary. Use flashcards with colors: blue for 'der', red for 'die', green for 'das'."
"Week 1","Day 3","The Nominative Case","Subject of the Sentence","The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence – the person or thing performing the action. The articles 'der', 'die', 'das' are in their basic form here.","Der Hund spielt.","The dog is playing.","This is the 'default' case. Think of it as the dictionary form of the noun and its article. When you learn a new noun, you learn it in the nominative."
"Week 1","Day 4","Verbs","Present Tense Conjugation (Regular)","Verbs change their endings based on the subject pronoun (ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie/Sie). Regular verbs follow a predictable pattern.","ich spiele, du spielst, wir spielen","I play, you play, we play","The infinitive verb usually ends in '-en' (e.g., 'spielen'). Drop the '-en' and add the correct ending: -e (ich), -st (du), -t (er/sie/es, ihr), -en (wir, sie/Sie)."
"Week 1","Day 5","Sentence Structure","Basic Word Order (SVO)","In simple statements, the word order is Subject-Verb-Object, just like in English. The conjugated verb is always the second element.","Ich kaufe einen Apfel.","I am buying an apple.","ALWAYS keep the conjugated verb in the second position in a simple sentence. This is a fundamental rule of German grammar."
"Week 1","Day 6","Essential Verbs","'sein' (to be) & 'haben' (to have)","These are the two most important verbs in German. They are irregular and must be memorized.","Ich bin müde. Er hat ein Auto.","I am tired. He has a car.","'sein' and 'haben' are also 'helping verbs' used to form other tenses later on, so learn their conjugations perfectly now. It will save you a lot of time."
"Week 1","Day 7","Review & Practice","Week 1 Consolidation","Review all topics from the week. Create simple sentences combining nouns, regular verbs, 'sein', and 'haben'.","Der Mann hat ein Buch. Die Frau ist hier.","The man has a book. The woman is here.","Try writing 5-10 simple sentences about yourself or your surroundings. Example: 'Ich bin [Your Name]. Ich lerne Deutsch. Ich habe einen Stift.'"
"Week 2","Day 8","The Accusative Case","Direct Object","The accusative case is used for the direct object – the thing that is directly receiving the action of the verb.","Ich sehe den Hund.","I see the dog.","ONLY the masculine article changes in the accusative: 'der' becomes 'den'. 'die' and 'das' stay the same. This is a huge shortcut! Remember 'den Mann', not 'der Mann' when he is the object."
"Week 2","Day 9","Pronouns","Personal Pronouns (Accusative)","The pronouns for 'me', 'you', 'him', etc., change in the accusative case.","Er sieht mich. Ich sehe ihn.","He sees me. I see him.","'mich' (me) and 'dich' (you) are very common. Notice 'ihn' (him) looks similar to 'den' (the masculine article). This is a helpful connection."
"Week 2","Day 10","Negation","'nicht' vs. 'kein'","'nicht' negates verbs, adjectives, or entire ideas. 'kein' negates nouns and is like saying 'not a' or 'no'.","Ich schlafe nicht. Ich habe keine Zeit.","I am not sleeping. I have no time.","Use 'kein' where you would use 'a/an' or 'no' in English (e.g., 'I have no dog'). 'kein' changes its ending just like 'ein' (e.g., keinen, keine). Use 'nicht' for everything else."
"Week 2","Day 11","Verbs","Present Tense (Irregular Verbs)","Some common verbs have a vowel change in the 'du' and 'er/sie/es' forms (e.g., e -> i, a -> ä).","Du sprichst Deutsch. Er fährt schnell.","You speak German. He drives fast.","The endings are still the same as regular verbs! Only the stem vowel changes. Make a list of these common verbs ('sprechen', 'fahren', 'lesen', 'sehen') and practice them."
"Week 2","Day 12","Questions","W-Fragen & Ja/Nein Fragen","W-Fragen (Wer? Was? Wo? Wann? Warum? Wie?) start with a question word, and the verb comes second. Ja/Nein questions start with the verb.","Wo wohnst du? Wohnst du in Berlin?","Where do you live? Do you live in Berlin?","For yes/no questions, just swap the subject and the verb from a normal sentence. 'Du wohnst in Berlin.' -> 'Wohnst du in Berlin?'"
"Week 2","Day 13","Nouns","Plural Forms","German noun plurals are tricky and have many different endings (-e, -er, -n, -s, no change).","ein Apfel -> zwei Äpfel, eine Frau -> zwei Frauen","one apple -> two apples, one woman -> two women","RULE: Always learn the plural form with the noun. There is no single rule. Many masculine/neuter nouns add '-e' or '-er' (often with an umlaut). Most feminine nouns add '-n' or '-en'."
"Week 2","Day 14","Review & Practice","Week 2 Consolidation","Practice forming sentences in the accusative, using negation, and asking questions.","Ich kaufe den Tisch nicht. Hast du keine Katze?","I am not buying the table. Do you not have a cat?","Try describing a room using accusative: 'Ich sehe einen Tisch, eine Lampe und ein Bett. Ich habe keinen Fernseher.'"
"Week 3","Day 15","The Dative Case","Indirect Object","The dative case is used for the indirect object – the person/thing that is receiving the direct object.","Ich gebe dem Mann das Buch.","I am giving the book to the man.","All articles change in the dative: der -> dem, die -> der, das -> dem, die (plural) -> den (+n on the noun). The dative often answers the question 'To whom?' or 'For whom?'"
"Week 3","Day 16","Pronouns","Personal Pronouns (Dative)","The pronouns for 'me', 'you', 'him', etc., change again in the dative case. 'mir' (to me) and 'dir' (to you) are extremely common.","Er gibt mir das Buch.","He gives the book to me.","Memorize 'mir' and 'dir' first. They are used in common phrases like 'Wie geht es dir?' (How are you?) - literally 'How goes it to you?'"
"Week 3","Day 17","Prepositions","Dative Prepositions","Certain prepositions ALWAYS take the dative case. These must be memorized.","Ich komme aus Deutschland. Ich wohne bei meiner Tante.","I come from Germany. I live with my aunt.","Memorize this list: aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu. Whenever you see one of these words, the noun that follows MUST be in the dative case."
"Week 3","Day 18","Prepositions","Accusative Prepositions","Certain prepositions ALWAYS take the accusative case.","Ich gehe durch den Park. Ich kaufe Blumen für dich.","I am walking through the park. I am buying flowers for you.","Memorize this list: durch, für, gegen, ohne, um. Whenever you see one, the noun that follows MUST be in the accusative case. 'für dich' (for you) is a very useful phrase."
"Week 3","Day 19","Word Order","Time, Manner, Place (TMP)","In sentences with multiple pieces of information, the general (but flexible) order is Time, Manner, Place.","Ich fahre heute mit dem Zug nach Hamburg.","I am traveling today by train to Hamburg.","(heute = Time, mit dem Zug = Manner, nach Hamburg = Place). This is a guideline, not a strict rule, but it's a great starting point for building longer sentences."
"Week 3","Day 20","Verbs","Modal Verbs (können, wollen, müssen)","Modal verbs ('can', 'want to', 'must') are used with another verb. The modal is conjugated and in the second position; the other verb is in the infinitive at the end.","Ich kann Deutsch sprechen.","I can speak German.","This word order is crucial: Verb 1 (modal) in position 2, Verb 2 (infinitive) at the very end. The modal verb conjugation is irregular, so memorize it."
"Week 3","Day 21","Review & Practice","Week 3 Consolidation","Build sentences using dative objects, prepositions, and modal verbs.","Ich will mit dir ins Kino gehen.","I want to go to the cinema with you.","Try to write a short paragraph about your daily routine using what you've learned. 'Am Morgen muss ich zur Arbeit fahren...'"
"Week 4","Day 22","Word Order","Conjunctions (Coordinating)","Coordinating conjunctions (aber, denn, und, sondern, oder) connect two main clauses without changing the word order. They are considered 'position zero'.","Ich bin müde, aber ich muss arbeiten.","I am tired, but I have to work.","Think of these as glue. The word order in the clause after the conjunction is just a normal S-V-O sentence. '...ich (S) muss (V) arbeiten (O/details).'"
"Week 4","Day 23","The Possessive","Possessive Articles (mein, dein, sein)","These words ('my', 'your', 'his') act like 'ein' and 'kein'. They get endings depending on the gender and case of the noun they describe.","Das ist mein Hund. Ich sehe deinen Hund.","This is my dog. I see your dog.","The base word tells you who owns it (mein=my, dein=your). The ending must match the noun's gender/case. 'deinen' = your + masculine accusative noun."
"Week 4","Day 24","The Imperative","Giving Commands","Used to tell someone to do something. There are forms for 'du' (informal you), 'ihr' (informal you all), and 'Sie' (formal you).","Geh nach Hause! Sprechen Sie bitte langsam!","Go home! Please speak slowly!","For the 'du' form, you often just drop the '-st' from the present tense verb. 'Du gehst' -> 'Geh!'. It's a direct command."
"Week 4","Day 25","Verbs","Separable Prefix Verbs","Some verbs have a prefix that separates and goes to the end of the sentence in the present tense.","Ich rufe dich an. Der Zug kommt um 18 Uhr an.","I am calling you. The train arrives at 6 PM.","'anrufen' (to call) -> prefix 'an' goes to the end. 'ankommen' (to arrive) -> prefix 'an' goes to the end. You learn these as whole verbs and just remember to split them."
"Week 4","Day 26","The Perfekt Tense","Conversational Past Tense","Used to talk about completed actions in the past. Formed with 'haben' or 'sein' as a helper verb + a past participle.","Ich habe gestern Pizza gegessen.","I ate pizza yesterday.","This is the most common way to speak about the past. Most verbs use 'haben'. Use 'sein' for verbs that involve movement (gehen, fahren) or a change of state (aufwachen - to wake up)."
"Week 4","Day 27","Past Participles","Building the Perfekt Tense","Regular past participles are formed with 'ge-' + verb stem + '-t' (e.g., gespielt). Irregular ones must be memorized.","gekauft, gemacht, gesehen, gegangen","bought, made, seen, gone","The past participle goes to the very end of the clause. 'Ich habe [details] [past participle].' Make flashcards for the irregular participles of common verbs."
"Week 4","Day 28","Final Review","Putting It All Together","Review all cases, tenses, and word order rules. Practice forming complex sentences.","Gestern habe ich meinen Freund im Café getroffen, und wir haben über unsere Pläne gesprochen.","Yesterday I met my friend in the café, and we talked about our plans.","Congratulations! You've covered all the core A1 grammar. Now it's all about practice, vocabulary building, and using the language as much as possible."
