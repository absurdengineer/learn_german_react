G001;Formal & Informal 'You' (Sie/du);Pronouns;German has a formal 'Sie' (for strangers, business, officials) and an informal 'du' (for friends, family, children). 'Sie' is always capitalized and uses the 3rd person plural verb form.;Use 'Sie' for respect with strangers and 'du' with friends.;1;2;;pronouns;;Siezen (using Sie) vs. Duzen (using du);When in doubt, always use 'Sie'. It's better to be too formal than too familiar.;Using 'du' without being invited can be a social faux pas in Germany. The older person or person of higher rank typically offers the 'du'.
G002;Present Tense of 'sein';Verbs;The verb 'sein' (to be) is highly irregular and must be memorized: ich bin, du bist, er/sie/es ist, wir sind, ihr seid, sie/Sie sind.;'sein' (to be) is irregular and essential. Memorize its forms.;2;3;G001;verbs;;ich bin, du bist, er/sie/es ist...;The 's' sound is present in almost all forms (bist, ist, sind, seid).;
G003;Present Tense of 'haben';Verbs;The verb 'haben' (to have) is irregular in the 2nd and 3rd person singular: ich habe, du hast, er/sie/es hat, wir haben, ihr habt, sie/Sie haben.;'haben' (to have) is irregular for 'du' and 'er/sie/es'. Memorize `du hast` and `er hat`.;2;3;G001;verbs;;ich habe, du hast, er/sie/es hat...;Think of 'haben' as having the regular '-st' and '-t' endings, but the 'b' gets dropped: `habst` -> `hast`, `habt` -> `hat`.;
G004;Noun Genders & Definite Articles;Nouns;Every German noun has a grammatical gender: Masculine (der), Feminine (die), or Neuter (das). This must be learned with the noun.;All nouns have a gender shown by their article: der, die, or das.;3;2;;nouns;;der Tisch, die Lampe, das Buch;Color-code your nouns when you learn them: der=blue, die=red, das=green.;The grammatical gender often has no connection to the real-world gender of the object.
G005;The Nominative Case;Cases;The Nominative case is for the **subject** of the sentence – the person or thing performing the action. It answers the question 'Wer/Was?' (Who/What?).;The Nominative case is for the subject of the sentence.;3;2;G004;nouns, pronouns;;**Der Mann** liest. (Who reads? The man.);'N' for Nominative and 'N' for 'Numero Uno'—the subject is #1.;
G006;Regular Verb Conjugation (Present Tense);Verbs;To conjugate a regular verb, drop the '-en' ending to find the stem, then add the personal ending: ich-e, du-st, er/sie/es-t, wir-en, ihr-t, sie/Sie-en.;Drop '-en' and add the right ending for the subject (e, st, t, en, t, en).;4;2;G001;verbs;Stems ending in -d/-t (arbeiten) or -m/-n (atmen) add an extra 'e' before -st and -t endings.;lernen -> ich lerne, du lernst...;Chant the endings like a rhythm: E-ST-T-EN-T-EN.;This pattern is the backbone of over 90% of German verbs.
G007;The V2 Rule (Verb Second);Word Order;In a standard German declarative sentence, the conjugated verb is ALWAYS the second element or 'idea'. The element in the first position can change for emphasis.;The conjugated verb is always the second piece of information in a sentence.;5;3;G006;all;Does not apply to yes/no questions or dependent clauses.;Position 1 | **Verb (Pos 2)** | Rest of sentence.;Think of the verb as the fixed pivot or anchor in position 2. Everything else can move around it.;This is the single most important rule in German syntax. Mastering it makes sentences sound natural.
G008;Inversion after Position 1 Element;Word Order;If an element other than the subject is in Position 1 (e.g., a time or place adverb), the subject must move to Position 3, immediately after the verb.;If the subject is not first, it moves to right after the verb.;5;3;G007;all;;Heute (1) **gehe** (2) ich (3) ins Kino.;The verb holds Position 2 so strongly, it forces the subject to move out of its way.;This creates emphasis on the element in the first position.
G009;The Accusative Case;Cases;The Accusative case is for the **direct object** – the noun directly receiving the action. It answers the question 'Wen/Was?' (Whom/What?).;The Accusative is for the direct object.;6;3;G005;nouns, pronouns;;Ich sehe den Mann. (Whom do I see? The man.);The direct object is the 'victim' of the verb's action.;
G010;Accusative Declension;Cases;In the Accusative case, only the masculine articles change: der -> den, ein -> einen, kein -> keinen, mein -> meinen, etc. Feminine, Neuter, and Plural articles do not change from their Nominative forms.;Only masculine articles change in the Accusative: der -> den.;6;3;G009;nouns, pronouns;;Ich habe **einen** Stuhl (m). vs. Ich habe **eine** Lampe (f).;Remember the 'N' for accusative: only the masculine article gets an 'N' at the end of 'de**n**'.;This is the most common case change you will encounter daily.
G011;Yes/No Questions (Entscheidungsfragen);Word Order;To form a question that can be answered with 'yes' or 'no' (eine Entscheidung), move the conjugated verb to Position 1.;Start the sentence with the conjugated verb to ask a yes/no question.;7;2;G007;all;;**Kommst** du aus Deutschland?;The verb is so excited to ask the question, it jumps to the very front of the line!;
G012;W-Fragen (Ergänzungsfragen);Word Order;To ask for information, start with a question word (W-Wort) like `Wer`, `Was`, `Wo`. The conjugated verb still comes in Position 2.;Put the W-Word first, then the conjugated verb in position 2.;7;2;G007;all;;**Wo** (1) **ist** (2) der Bahnhof?;The V2 rule is so strong, the W-Word takes position 1 and the verb stays firmly in position 2.;
G013;Negation with 'nicht';Grammar;`nicht` negates verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, specific nouns (with a definite article), and prepositional phrases. Its position can vary, but it often comes after the verb.;`nicht` negates actions and descriptions.;8;3;G007;all;;Ich schlafe **nicht**. Das ist **nicht** teuer.;Think of `nicht` as the general-purpose 'not'.;
G014;Negation with 'kein';Grammar;`kein` is a negative article that negates a noun that has NO article or an INDEFINITE article ('ein'/'eine'). It declines just like `ein`.;`kein` means 'not a' or 'no' and is used only for nouns.;8;3;G010;nouns;;Ich habe **kein** Auto. Ich sehe **keinen** Hund.;If you can replace 'not' with 'not a/an' in English, you need `kein`.;
G015;Common Irregular Verbs (Vowel Change);Verbs;Many common 'strong' verbs change their stem vowel in the 2nd ('du') and 3rd ('er/sie/es') person singular. Common patterns are a -> ä, e -> i, or e -> ie.;Some common verbs have a vowel change only for 'du' and 'er/sie/es'.;9;3;G006;verbs;The `ich`, `wir`, `ihr`, `sie/Sie` forms are usually regular.;fahren -> er f**ä**hrt; geben -> er g**i**bt; sehen -> er s**ie**ht.;Focus on the change for 'du' and 'er/sie/es'. The rest of the conjugation is usually normal.;
G016;Modal Verbs (Concept & Word Order);Verbs;Modal verbs (`können`, `wollen`, etc.) modify another verb. The modal is conjugated in Position 2, and the main verb goes to the end of the sentence in its infinitive form.;Modal verb is conjugated in Position 2, the other verb goes to the end.;10;4;G007;verbs;;Ich **kann** gut Deutsch **sprechen**.;The main verb gets ""kicked"" to the very end by the modal verb.;
G017;Modal Verbs (Conjugation);Verbs;Modal verbs have irregular conjugations. Crucially, the 'ich' and 'er/sie/es' forms are always identical.;The 1st and 3rd person singular forms (ich, er/sie/es) are the same for all modal verbs.;10;3;G016;verbs;;ich kann, er kann; ich will, er will; ich muss, er muss...;This is a key identifying feature of modal verbs.;
G018;Politeness with 'möchten';Verbs;`wollen` (to want) can sound demanding. For polite requests (e.g., in a restaurant), use `möchten` (would like).;Use 'möchten' to be more polite than 'wollen'.;10;3;G017;verbs;;Ich will ein Wasser! vs. Ich möchte ein Wasser, bitte.;`möchten` is your magic word for politeness in cafés and shops.;`möchten` is technically the subjunctive form of `mögen` (to like), which makes it sound less direct and therefore more polite.
G0D19;Possessive Articles;Nouns;Possessive articles (`mein`, `dein`, `sein`, etc.) show ownership. They get endings that match the case and gender of the noun they describe, just like 'ein'.;'my', 'your', 'his', etc. get case/gender endings just like 'ein'.;11;3;G010;nouns;;mein Hund (m), mein**e** Katze (f), mein**en** Hund (m, acc).;The ending on the possessive article depends on the noun it describes, NOT the gender of the owner.;
G020;The Dative Case;Cases;The Dative case is for the **indirect object** – typically the receiver of the direct object. It answers the question 'Wem?' (To whom?).;The Dative is for the indirect object (the receiver).;12;4;G010;nouns, pronouns;;Ich gebe **dem Mann** das Buch.;The indirect object is the 'beneficiary' or 'recipient' of the action.;
G021;Dative Declension;Cases;All articles change in the Dative: der/das -> dem, die -> der, plural die -> den (+n on noun). `ein` becomes `einem`/`einer`.;All articles change in the Dative: dem, der, dem, den.;12;4;G020;nouns, pronouns;;dem Mann, der Frau, dem Kind, den Kindern;Chant the changes: M-R-M-N (de**m**, de**r**, de**m**, de**n** Plural). The feminine `die` becomes `der`, which is a common trap!;
G022;Dative Prepositions;Prepositions;Some prepositions ALWAYS take the Dative case, regardless of context. The most common are: `aus`, `bei`, `mit`, `nach`, `seit`, `von`, `zu`.;These prepositions always trigger the Dative case for the noun that follows.;13;4;G021;nouns;;Ich fahre **mit dem** Bus.;Learn the prepositions to the tune of a song, like the Blue Danube Waltz: ""aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu!"";
G023;Separable Prefix Verbs;Verbs;Many verbs have a prefix that separates and goes to the end of the sentence in the present tense. The main verb part is conjugated in Position 2.;The prefix breaks off and goes to the end of the sentence.;14;3;G007;verbs;In dependent clauses or with modal verbs, the prefix rejoins the verb at the end.;anrufen -> Ich **rufe** dich **an**.;The prefix is like a boomerang. You say the verb, but throw the prefix to the end.;Examples: `einkaufen` (shop), `fernsehen` (watch TV), `aufstehen` (get up).
G024;The Perfekt Tense (Spoken Past);Verbs;Used to talk about the past in conversation. It's formed with a helping verb (`haben` or `sein`) in Position 2 and a past participle at the end.;Form the spoken past with 'haben' or 'sein' in Position 2 and the past participle at the end.;15;4;G008;verbs;;Ich **habe** Pizza **gemacht**.;It works just like a modal verb sentence structure. The participle gets ""kicked"" to the end.;This tense is used in over 95% of spoken past situations in Germany.
G025;Past Participle Formation;Verbs;Regular (weak) verbs form the past participle with `ge-` + stem + `-t` (gemacht). Irregular (strong) verbs often use `ge-` + stem + `-en` (gesprochen).;Regular past participles end in -t; irregular ones often end in -en.;15;3;G024;verbs;Verbs ending in `-ieren` and inseparable prefix verbs do not get a `ge-` prefix.;Regular: ge-lern-t. Irregular: ge-sproch-en.;The `ge-` is like a 'past tense badge'.;
G026;Choosing 'haben' or 'sein' for Perfekt;Verbs;Use 'sein' for verbs of A-to-B motion (`gehen`, `fahren`) and changes of state (`aufstehen`). Use 'haben' for almost everything else.;Use 'sein' for verbs of movement or change of state; use 'haben' for most other verbs.;17;3;G024;verbs;The verbs 'sein' (to be) and 'bleiben' (to stay) also use 'sein' as a helper.;**bin** gefahren (movement) vs. **habe** gegessen (action);If you can ask ""Where to?"" about the verb's action, it likely uses `sein`.;
G027;Accusative Prepositions;Prepositions;Some prepositions ALWAYS take the Accusative case. The most common are: `durch`, `für`, `gegen`, `ohne`, `um`.;These prepositions always trigger the Accusative case for the noun that follows.;17;3;G010;nouns;;Ich kaufe ein Geschenk **für den** Freund.;Remember the acronym FUDGO: Für, Um, Durch, Gegen, Ohne.;
G028;Two-Way Prepositions;Prepositions;Nine prepositions (`in, an, auf...`) can take either Accusative OR Dative. Use Accusative for movement/direction (`Wohin?`). Use Dative for static location (`Wo?`).;Accusative for direction (`Wohin?`), Dative for location (`Wo?`).;18;5;G021, G010;nouns;;Ich gehe **in die** Schule (Acc). Ich bin **in der** Schule (Dat).;Accusative has an 'A' for Action and movement. Dative is for a 'Dot on a map', a fixed location.;This is a core concept of German grammar that allows for great precision.
G029;The Imperative (Commands);Verbs;The imperative mood is used to give commands. It has different forms for `du`, `ihr`, and `Sie`.;Use special verb forms to give commands.;19;3;G006;verbs;Irregular verbs with a vowel change in the 'du' form keep that change in the command.;`du`: Komm! / `ihr`: Kommt! / `Sie`: Kommen Sie!;Add `bitte` (please) to any command to make it polite.;
G030;Coordinating Conjunctions (ADUSO);Word Order;Conjunctions like `und`, `aber`, `oder`, `denn`, `sondern` connect two main clauses without changing the word order. They are in 'Position 0'.;ADUSO conjunctions connect sentences but don't change the V2 word order.;20;2;G007;all;;Ich gehe, **und du** kommst. (verb `kommst` is in pos 2).;Remember the acronym ADUSO: Aber, Denn, Und, Sondern, Oder.;`denn` and `weil` both mean 'because', but `denn` is a coordinator (V2) and `weil` is a subordinator (verb last).
G031;Subordinating Conjunctions (Verb-last);Word Order;Subordinating conjunctions like `weil` and `dass` introduce a dependent clause. In these clauses, the conjugated verb is kicked to the very end.;These words introduce a side-thought and kick the conjugated verb to the very end of that clause.;21;4;G007;all;;Ich lerne Deutsch, **weil** ich in Deutschland **wohne**.;`weil` and `dass` are 'verb-kickers'. They boot the conjugated verb to the end.;This verb-last structure is a hallmark of formal and written German.
G032;Personal Pronouns in Accusative;Pronouns;When a personal pronoun is the direct object, it must be in the accusative form: ich -> mich, du -> dich, er -> ihn, sie -> sie, es -> es, wir -> uns, ihr -> euch, sie/Sie -> sie/Sie.;Direct object pronouns change: I -> me (`ich` -> `mich`), you -> you (`du` -> `dich`), he -> him (`er` -> `ihn`).;6;3;G009;pronouns;;Er sieht **mich**. Ich frage **ihn**.;'me' (`mich`) and 'him' (`ihn`) are the key ones to remember as different from English.;
G033;Personal Pronouns in Dative;Pronouns;When a personal pronoun is the indirect object, it must be in the dative form: ich -> mir, du -> dir, er -> ihm, sie -> ihr, es -> ihm, wir -> uns, ihr -> euch, sie/Sie -> ihnen/Ihnen.;Indirect object pronouns change: I -> me (`ich` -> `mir`), you -> you (`du` -> `dir`), he -> him (`er` -> `ihm`).;12;4;G020;pronouns;;Er gibt **mir** das Buch. Ich helfe **dir**.;The `mir`/`dir` forms are very common and must be learned by heart.;The phrase `Wie geht es dir?` literally means 'How goes it to you?'. `dir` is dative.
G034;Adjective Endings (Basics);Adjectives;When an adjective comes before a noun, it needs an ending. The ending depends on the article before it, and the case/gender of the noun.;Adjectives before nouns need endings.;23;5;G021, G010;adjectives;Adjectives that come after the noun (predicate adjectives) do not get endings.;ein rot**es** Auto, der rot**e** Bus, den rot**en** Bus;This is a B1 topic to master, but A1 learners must recognize that the endings exist and change.;
G035;Comparative and Superlative;Adjectives;To compare, add `-er` to an adjective (schneller). For the superlative, use `am` + adjective + `-sten` (am schnellsten). Use `als` for 'than'.;Add -er for 'more ... than' (`...-er als`) and use 'am ...-sten' for 'the most'.;24;3;G034;adjectives;Irregular forms: gut -> besser; viel -> mehr; gern -> lieber.;schnell, schneller, am schnellsten;This structure is very similar to English, making it one of the easier grammar points.;
G036;Expressing Likes with 'gern';Adverbs;To say you like doing an activity (verb), add the adverb `gern` after the conjugated verb. `Ich spiele gern Tennis.` (I like to play tennis.);Use 'gern' after a verb to say you like doing that action.;25;2;G006;verbs;;Ich koche gern. vs. Ich mag Pizza.;This is much more common than using `lieben` (to love) for general activities.;
G037;Ordinal Numbers and Dates;Numbers;Ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd...) are formed with `-te` (for 1-19) or `-ste` (for 20+). To state a date, use `am` + ordinal number + `-n`.;1st=`erste`, 2nd=`zweite`, 20th=`zwanzigste`. On a date = `am ...-ten/-sten`.;26;3;;numbers;Exceptions: 1st (erste), 3rd (dritte).;`am ersten Mai`, `am zwanzigsten Dezember`;Writing dates is always DD.MM.YYYY in Germany.
G038;Präteritum of 'sein' and 'haben';Verbs;The simple past (Präteritum) is mostly for written German, but for `sein` and `haben` it is very common in speech: `ich war` (I was), `du warst` etc.; `ich hatte` (I had), `du hattest` etc.;The spoken past of 'to be' and 'to have' is often the simple past: `ich war` and `ich hatte`.;15;3;G002, G003;verbs;;Ich **war** krank. Ich **hatte** keine Zeit.;This is an exception to the "Perfekt for spoken past" rule. Using `Ich bin krank gewesen` sounds clumsy.;
G039;Plural Noun Forms;Nouns;German has many ways to form plurals (-e, -er, -n, -s, no change, etc.). It's best to learn the plural form with each new noun.;Plurals are irregular. Learn the plural form for each noun individually.;4;4;G004;nouns;;der Tisch, die Tische; der Apfel, die Äpfel; die Frau, die Frauen; das Auto, die Autos;There are patterns, but they have many exceptions. Memorization is the most reliable strategy.
G040;Indefinite Pronouns;Pronouns;Words like `man` (one/you general), `jemand` (someone), `niemand` (no one), `etwas` (something), `nichts` (nothing), and `alles` (everything) are used to talk about people or things in a non-specific way.;`man` (one), `jemand` (someone), `niemand` (no one) are used to talk about non-specific people.;11;3;;pronouns;;`Man` darf hier nicht rauchen. (One may not smoke here.);`man` is always conjugated like `er/sie/es`.
G041;Question Word Cases (Wen/Wem);Cases;The question word 'wer' (who) changes based on the case: `Wen` for Accusative (Whom?), and `Wem` for Dative (To whom?).;Use 'Wen?' to ask for the direct object and 'Wem?' for the indirect object.;12;4;G009, G020;pronouns;;**Wen** siehst du? **Wem** hilfst du?;This directly mirrors the `er` -> `ihn` -> `ihm` declension.;
G042;Reflexive Verbs (Accusative);Verbs;Reflexive verbs use a pronoun that refers back to the subject. In the accusative, the pronouns are `mich`, `dich`, `sich`, `uns`, `euch`, `sich`.;A reflexive verb is an action done to oneself. The pronoun matches the subject.;19;4;G032;verbs;;Ich wasche **mich**. Er wäscht **sich**.;`sich` is used for er/sie/es and sie/Sie.
